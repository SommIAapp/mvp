  # Disable Row Level Security on all tables

  1. Security Changes
    - Disable RLS on all tables to fix authentication and profile creation errors
    - Remove all existing RLS policies
    - This allows unrestricted access to all data (use with caution)

  2. Tables affected
    - failed_queries
    - stripe_subscriptions  
    - user_analytics
    - recommendation_feedback
    - stripe_orders
    - recommendations
    - wines
    - user_profiles
    - popular_dishes
    - stripe_customers

  3. Important Notes
    - This removes all data access restrictions
    - Consider re-enabling RLS with proper policies in production
    - All data will be accessible to any authenticated user
